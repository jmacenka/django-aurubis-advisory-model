# Userstory 1
As an furnance operator
I want to have a graphical representation of the O2-level in the furnance as well as the predicted time when the O2-level will reach the determined set value
in order to react in time and prevent the furnance from overshooting the O2 target value.

# Userstory 2  
As a furnance operator
I want a graphical alarm that tells me when to execute my next Celox O2-measurement
in order to react in time to do so.

# Userstory 3
As a furnance operator,
I want to see a list of all the latest Celox O2-measurements with the possibility to de-select some of them that where wrong measurements as to my knowledge, also I want to have a feedback function to inform if the celox measurement was correct or not
in order to avoid wrong measurements being taken into account in the algorithm.

# Userstory 4
As a data analyst,
I want to have the capability to tune the algorithms parameters during production to adapt to changing conditions and to improve the algorithms performance, also I want the changes to be version-controlled and logged
in order to improve the algorithms performance and to be able to reproduce the results.

# Userstory 5
As a IT operator,
I want the Application to support multiple users with different roles and permissions that eventually might be connected to our company AD but for now can reside inside the application itsself
in order to to be compliant with access-control policies.

# Userstory 6
As a line manager,
I want the capability to easily export reports of the furnance performance and the Celox O2-measurements from the application 
in order to discuss them with my operators to improve future performance.
